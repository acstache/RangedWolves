Simply put this into your plugins folder, and it will do it's magic!
Makes wolves from Mob Arena attack your target when you attack at range.
If you're not in an arena, it will not work.
If your target is another player, it will not work.
If you use a bow & arrow, egg, or snowball, it *should* work.
    I have not tested with eggs or snowballs.
